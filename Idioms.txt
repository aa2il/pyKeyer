Cat got your tongue?
That’s easier said than done
Go the extra mile
Finding a needle in a haystack
Go jump in a lake
Go soak your head

He has a short fuse
Give you a taste of your own medicine
I have butterflies in my stomach
You won by the skin of your teeth
Crying wolf
Cut me some slack
He’s Down for the count
That’s where I draw the line
Every cloud has a silver lining
I feel like a fish out of water
There’s something I want to get off my chest
Give it a whirl
Go down in flames
Hang in there
In the fast lane
In the nick of time
Let the cat out of the bag
Let the chips fall where they may
Lose your marbles
Once in a blue moon
Plain as day
Play second fiddle
Put your foot in your mouth
Pull yourself together
Sick and tired
Let me sleep on it
Snug as a bug in a rug
Step up your game
Stick your nose into something
That’s straight from the horse’s mouth
Take it easy
This is just the tip of the iceberg
He can’t see the wood for the trees
Up a creek without a paddle
